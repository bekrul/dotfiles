# BashCommonSrc - code to be executed at the beginning of nearly all my bash scripts.  
################################################################################

# The following three lines should start out each script, even
# if they are duplicated here, because they are very important.
# They stop the script at the first sign of something wrong, much
# preferable to undefined behavior on the filesystem.  

# error on usage of an unset variable
set -o nounset
# same command, above is more readable
#set -u

# exit script if any command returns a nonzero value
set -o errexit
# same thing, but above is more readable
#set -e

# return error if any command in a pipeline fails, instead of using
# return code of last command in pipe.  
# Note: not appropriate for all scripts
#set -o pipefail

#useful debugging flags...
# print each command to stdout before executing it
#set -v

# print each expanded command to stdout before executing it
#set -x

#set -o verbose
# ensure this file only gets sourced once, otherwise behavior of OrigDir will be incorrect.  
if [ -z "${BashCommonSrcRan+x}" ]; then
    BashCommonSrcRan="ran"
else
    echo "BashCommonSrc already sourced - returning"

# BHK Note, saw this recommendation but not sure i want to include this is all scripts,
# so i've left it commented out.
# Set the Internal Field Separator to include tabs and newlines, default value
# also includes spaces
#IFS=$'\n\t'

# save directory at the beginning of script execution so we can return there at the end
OrigDir=$(pwd)

# Get path to the executing script.  This does NOT work.  If the script is executed
# from the same directory, $0 will contain no path!  
#ScriptPath="$(dirname "$0")"
