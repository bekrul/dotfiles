use the default installation options

i like setting up the following hotkeys:
NAV: Move left - Ctrl Left Arrow
NAV: Move right - Ctrl Right Arrow
NAV: Move up - Ctrl Up Arrow
NAV: Move down - Ctrl Down Arrow
WIN: Move left and follow - Ctrl Alt Left Arrow 
WIN: Move right and follow - Ctrl Alt Right Arrow
WIN: Move up and follow - Ctrl Alt Up Arrow
WIN: Move down and follow - Ctrl Alt Down Arrow 

Note:  the above hotkeys to move and follow are used by Intel Graphics Chip Driver to rotate the desktop.  If 
this is the case, you must reassign the hotkeys used by the intel driver (disabling is not sufficient).
system tray -> Intel HD Graphics -> properties -> options and support -> Manage Hot Keys
Also disable these hotkeys, as they are annoying.  
Then click apply
