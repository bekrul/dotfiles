Vim installation notes for Windows 7
====================================

-------------
General Notes
-------------
The terminal version of vim gets installed via selecting the vim package during
cygwin install.  However, the windows gvim application is preferable for
general use.  One of the only times i use the terminal version is when
opening a file that is a symbolic link, as the windows application can't
follow cygwin symbolic links.  

The following instructions install gvim and then configure both gvim and the cygwin
command line vim to use the same configuration.  As windows programs (gvim) can't follow
cygwin symbolic links, we copy a real file to a location that gvim checks for vimrc files.  
This file than sources the vimrc maintained in repository, so that changes to vimrc under 
source control does not require reinstallation for gvim.  

An alias in my bashrc file allows me to open windows gvim application from 
cygwin bash prompt.  

These notes are somewhat based on instructions downloaded from vim.org:
~/dotfiles/vim/ugrankar.pdf.  They are abbreviated for my use.  

-----------------
gvim Installation
-----------------
In Windows Explorer run:
C:\cygwin64\home\<username>\dotfiles\vim\installers\gvim74.exe
select Full installation
change installation directory to:
C:\Users\<username>\Vim
This way, _vimrc file and any extensions we add are located in user directory
instead of C:\Program Files.  This is better because the install location has no
spaces in the path, and access to Program Files is controlled by Windows.  

---------------------
create .vim directory
---------------------
for gvim:
$ mkdir /cygdrive/C/Users/<username>/Vim/vimfiles
for terminal vim:
$ mkdir  ~/.vim

---------------
setup autoloads
---------------
skip this section
This step was recommended as precursor to pathogen install on windows, but i'm
not using pathogen at this time.  
#$ mv vim74\autoload vimfiles\autoload   
# instead, for now, just create empty autoloads directory:
#$ mkdir vimfiles\autoload

--------------
setup pathogen
--------------
Skip this section - as the only 'plugins' i use are colorschemes, pathogen is not needed.  
Left these notes here as lots of sites seem to recommend using pathogen, ill probably have 
to use it eventually.
$ cd /cygdrive/c/Users/<username>/Vim
$ mkdir vimfiles/bundle
$ cp ~/dotfiles/vim/vimfiles/autoload/pathogen.vim vimfiles/autoload
Note:  the doc from vim.org suggests installing vim-kolor this way.  However, it seems simpler
to just copy it directly into vimfiles/colors for my purposes.  
# install vim-kolor colorscheme...
#$ cp ~/dotfiles/vim/bundles/vim-kolor vimfiles/bundle


-------------------
setup color schemes
-------------------
for gvim:
$ cp -r ~/dotfiles/vim/vimfiles/colors /cygdrive/C/Users/<username>/Vim/vimfiles
for terminal vim:
$ ln -s /cygdrive/C/Users/<username>/Vim/vimfiles/colors ~/.vim/colors

Note that the color schemes in the terminal version of vim are kindof ugly
because only 16 colors are used.  There are ways to fix this, but i
don't use the terminal version of vim very often so haven't gotten around to
addressing this.  

-----------
Setup vimrc
-----------
for terminal vim:
$ mv -n ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc_post
$ ln -s ~/dotfiles/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
for gvim:
$ cp -n ~/dotfiles/vim/vimrc_WINDOWS /cygdrive/C/Users/$USER/Vim/_vimrc 
review the old vimrc file now at ~/.vimrc_post and move/delete it unless needed.
